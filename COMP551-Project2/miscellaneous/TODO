We need to try with and without stemming the words, with or without stopwords 
Test different effect of preprocessing on result..
Try out different stemming functions 
Remove punctuations ? 
Remove Youtube links and random symbol like &2gt 
Try model using GridSearch CV 
Implement PCA 
Change all classes to number features
investigate n-grams
Try ensemble method (Bagging, stacking methods if time allows)
Multinomial NB in sklearn should beat TA's baseline

Strip spaces before and at the end of sentence
Get rid of newlines
Add features about comment length of each words 
Plot by subreddit:
Average comment length

October 18th 
Add stopwords by investigating term frequency for each subreddit
Add features about "the number of words" see if it helps ?
Investigate mean and variance of every subreddit word count see if it varies a lot then it can't be used as a feature.
